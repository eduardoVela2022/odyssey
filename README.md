## PROJECT 3: Travel Adventures - Personal Journey Organizer (Odyssey)

The primary goal of this application is to help users organize and manage their personal travel adventures. Users can document their upcoming trips, including the destinations they plan to visit and the activities they might do in each city.

## User Story

AS A travel enthusiast,  
I WANT a personal travel organizer application,  
SO THAT I can plan my trips and keep track of the activities I want to do in each destination.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a personal travel organizer application:

- WHEN I load the website,  
  THEN I am presented with a secure login and registration system to ensure that only I can view and manage my travel plans.
- WHEN I log in,  
  THEN I see a dashboard displaying all my planned trips.
- WHEN I create a new trip,  
  THEN I am able to document the destination, country, departure date, and return date.
- WHEN I view a trip,  
  THEN I can see a detailed overview of the trip, including all the activities I plan to do in that city.
- WHEN I add an activity to a trip,  
  THEN I can document specific activities, including a title and description.
- WHEN I delete an activity,  
  THEN the activity is removed from the trip without affecting the rest of the plan.
- WHEN I delete a trip,  
  THEN the entire trip and all associated activities are removed from my dashboard.

## Technologies Used
